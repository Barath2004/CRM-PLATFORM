6 Summary of AI Tools and Tech Stack Used
üß† AI/ML Tools:
OpenAI SDK (openai npm package): Used for customer segmentation logic through prompt-based AI.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies:
Frontend:

React 18

React Router

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Vite (build tool)

Lucide Icons

react-beautiful-dnd (drag-and-drop UI interactions)

Dev Tools:

ESLint (linting)

PostCSS (CSS transformations)

UUID (for unique identifiers)
7 Known Limitations / Assumptions
No backend or persistent database: All segmentation logic is assumed to happen in-browser or via direct API calls.

API Key handling: OpenAI key must be provided, likely from environment variables or a local config (not secure for production if exposed to frontend).

Limited scalability: AI calls are client-side and could lead to rate limiting or exposure of usage.

Assumes structured customer data: Works best if data is pre-cleaned or statically defined in the UI layer.
